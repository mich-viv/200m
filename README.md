# 200m

This web app was created during covid 19 restriction in Italy.</br>
The user is able to search for his address and then, by clicking on it, to plot a circle of radius 200m.</br>
The circle was ment to be a limit in which the user was able to do physical activity during lockdown.</br>

The map is opensource (OpenStreetMaps) and to plot on it the JS library Leaflet was used.
